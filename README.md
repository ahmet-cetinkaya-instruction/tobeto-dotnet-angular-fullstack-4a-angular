# Tobeto .NET Angular Fullstack 4.A - Frontend Angular Training

This repository is a snapshot created for documentation and knowledge-sharing purposes, capturing the content of a technical training delivered for a specific audience. The training focused on building a dynamic, single-page application using Angular and related frontend technologies.

## Main Covered Topics

- **Angular Fundamentals**: Core concepts including Components, Services, Modules, Data Binding (`@Input`, `@Output`), and event handling.
- **Routing and Navigation**: Implementation of application routing, including lazy loading for feature modules and route guards for securing access.
- **Asynchronous Programming with RxJS**: Extensive use of Observables, Subjects (`Subject`, `BehaviorSubject`), and operators for managing asynchronous data flows and state.
- **HTTP Communication**: Interaction with a backend API using `HttpClient`, including the use of interceptors for handling authentication tokens.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Built a complete login and logout flow, managed user sessions with `LocalStorage`, and protected routes using `CanActivate` guards.
- **Advanced Angular Features**: Created custom structural directives (`*ifNot`), attribute directives (`highlight`), and pipes for data transformation (e.g., VAT calculation).
- **UI/UX with Bootstrap**: Developed a responsive UI with shared components like navigation bars, layouts, cards, and pagination.
- **State Management**: Explored component-level state management and communication between components.
- **Practical Application**: The training included building a sample e-commerce frontend ("Northwind") with features like product and category lists, filtering, and paginated data display.
